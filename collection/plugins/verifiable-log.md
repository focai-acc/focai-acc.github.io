# Plugin-tee-verifiable-log

## Overview

While Eliza operates within the TEE, it uses a derived key pair to sign its actions, ensuring that these actions are definitively executed by Eliza. Third-party users can remotely verify Eliza's public key to validate these actions.

## Features

- **Action Signing**: Automatic signing of all Eliza actions using TEE-derived keys
- **Remote Verification**: Third-party verification of Eliza's actions
- **Transparent Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations

## Technical Details

### Key Generation
- Secure key derivation within TEE
- Automatic key rotation policies
- Protected private key storage

### Verification Process
1. Action execution in TEE
2. Signature generation
3. Public verification
4. Log storage

### Integration Points
- TEE runtime environment
- Blockchain verification nodes
- External verification tools

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Management**
   - Secure key generation
   - Protected storage
   - Regular rotation

2. **Verification Process**
   - Multi-node verification
   - Timestamp validation
   - Signature integrity

3. **Log Protection**
   - Tamper-proof storage
   - Encrypted transmission
   - Backup procedures
