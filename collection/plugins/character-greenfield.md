# Plugin-Character-GreenField

## Overview

Writes the "free will" data of AI agents—character files, memory, knowledge—into GreenField in near real-time. If a TEE node shuts down, another node can download the data and resume operations, ensuring continuity of AI agent personalities and experiences.

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Store AI agent data on GreenField network
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Continuous data updates
- **Secure Recovery**: TEE-protected data restoration
- **Cross-Node Compatibility**: Seamless agent migration
