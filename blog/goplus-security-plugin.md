# Introduce the GoPlus Security plugin for Eliza

After an inspiring dinner conversation with
@shawmakesmagic
 in Beijing last month, we began diving deep into AI agent frameworks. We made the decision to integrate
@GoPlusSecurity
 security capabilities into Eliza, and in less than two weeks, we successfully developed the GoPlus Security plugin. We are excited to announce that the release of the GoPlus Security plugin for Eliza
@ai16zdao
 will come true, also partnering with
@focEliza
 which is a dedicated branch of Eliza focused on making AI agent fully on-chain. This release is a groundbreaking integration that brings comprehensive Web3 security capabilities to AI agents, enabling all Eliza-based AI agents with professional-grade on-chain security protection.

This plugin seamlessly integrates GoPlus security infrastructure, providing AI agents with the following key security capabilities:
- Token Security Detection
- NFT Security Detection
- Phishing Website Detection
- Malicious Authorization Detection
- Malicious Signature Detection

Supporting 30+ blockchains including mainstream EVM chains, Solana and Sui, making it the most comprehensive security solution for AI agents.

The plugin enables AI agents to perform various security-enhanced functions:
- Trading and Investment
Automatic security screening of tokens before trading1
Risk assessment of liquidity pools and yield farming opportunities
Detection of potential rug pulls or scam projects
- Asset Management
Continuous monitoring of approved contracts
Automatic revocation of high-risk approvals
Security-aware rebalancing strategies
- Community Management
Automatic filtering of phishing links in community channels
Risk alerts for trending but potentially dangerous projects
Protection of community members from scams

As the first team to introduce security capabilities into ElizaOS core module, we're proud to lay the foundation for secure AI agent interactions in Web3. This is just the beginning - we're committed to continuously building and contributing to this essential infrastructure.
With DeFi agents set to revolutionize on-chain interactions, security will be paramount. As a dedicated Web3 security layer, GoPlus is positioned to work closely with AI agents to ensure safe and reliable operations.
Stay tuned! More interesting things are coming! Security with ai agent can also be sexyðŸ«¦
