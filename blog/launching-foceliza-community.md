# Launching focEliza public good community

We announce the establishment of the focEliza public good community to effectively accelerate the development and application of fully on-chain Eliza,  a suite of ElizaOS plugins, tools, and services designed for fully on-chain AI agents.

Since initiating the focEliza project and releasing related updates, we have received a great deal of attention and engagement, along with very positive feedback. People are highly enthusiastic about the concept of fully verifiable, trustless, fully autonomous, and chain-interoperable AI Agents. This enthusiasm is the starting point for establishing the public good community. We aim to inherit the community culture of ai16z, fostering open collaboration to effectively accelerate this concept. The focEliza public good community will serve as a gathering place for enthusiasts, cutting through market noise, building consensus, and collaboratively creating practical, fun, and chill products. Most importantly, we aim to carry forward ai16z’s spirit of open-source and community.

We will not release a whitepaper, there will be no VC, no team, and we will not write lengthy explanations about why we need fully-on-chain AI agents or outline multi-year plans for focEliza. We will simply focus on building the necessary and exciting features right in front of us, step by step, enabling AI agents to go on-chain and trustless. I believe that through growth within the community and market, focalize will naturally progress along an effective co-building path: something people care about, will use, and that contributes to Eliza’s development.

Additionally, to ensure focEliza starts light and agile, I will explain focEliza’s architecture and challenges today to help it move forward quickly and efficiently.

1. **Early Contributor to focEliza**
As the CTO of Artela, our team initiated this project because we were bullish about this direction and saw great potential in AI16z and Eliza.

    Now, the focEliza public good community has been established and will continue to grow under the public good community. The Artela team will remain a long-term contributor, providing ongoing funding to support the development of the focEliza community.

    Thanks to Artela and Jerry for all the support that made this possible!

2. **"When CA?"**

    Over the past two weeks, many people have asked me about this. As the initiator of the community, I want to clarify from the start: **Maybe, there will be something**, but I don’t yet know in what form. **I firmly believe this will be an important part of effective acceleration.**

    I have seen Shaw deeply troubled by misunderstandings around ai16z-related "CA," and the community has faced difficult-to-explain misconceptions, requiring a public restructuring.

    I will address this from the very beginning because, as a public good, it will establish partnerships with everyone transparently. I will tell everyone: If you mind, please be aware.

3. **How will the community be organized?**

    So far, many enthusiasts have contacted me about how to participate in co-building. My initial response has been to wait until we clarify our plans.

    Currently, the community consists of **myself, Mike, and several anonymous engineers, product managers, and ecosystem developers.**

    The first step will be open recruitment through a form to onboard the first batch of partners. We don’t aim to assemble a 1,000-person team immediately but will start with a focused team of 20 people and build from there.

4. **What will the community do, and who should join first?**

    Key community priorities include:

    - Development of focEliza
    - Building the first fun AI agent based on focEliza
    - Expert community organizers
    - Ecosystem players
    - Researchers
    - People and ideas that can effectively accelerate everything

    If you are bullish on fully on-chain Eliza, please join us! Keep it limited to 15 people in the early stages. Apply here: <https://forms.gle/bzz7884p3U439AMD8>
