## focEliza-based AI agent

- Focai: The first immortal, unkillable on-chain AI agent ape. 
- AiVinci: Captain of Fully on-chain AI Agents and Artela community.

## Finish Features
- Plugin-tee-verifiable-log

  While Eliza operates within the TEE, it uses a derived key pair to sign its actions, ensuring that these actions are definitively executed by Eliza. Third-party users can remotely verify Eliza's public key to validate these actions.

- Plugin-tee-onchain-da
  
  Eliza writes the "life" information of a specified AI agent‚Äîsuch as character files, memory, and keystore‚Äîinto the blockchain (or DA layer) in near real-time. If the TEE node running the specified AI agent shuts down for any reason, another TEE node can download the AI agent's "life" data from the chain and resume its operation. This data is encrypted by the TEE, ensuring that only the same version of TEE Eliza can download and restore the agent.

- Plugin-goplus-tee

  The plugin seamlessly integrates GoPlus security infrastructure, providing AI agents with the following key security capabilities: Token Security Detection, NFT Security Detection, Phishing Website Detection, Malicious Authorization Detection, and Malicious Signature Detection.

- FocEliza Verifiable Terminal

  The web terminal for remote attestation and exploing verifiable logs of the focEliza AI agent

## On-going Features

- Plugin-BitLife-tee

  Implements on-chain genotype synthesis and evolution based on Conway's Game of Life rules. Includes TEE-enabled computation for genotype evolution and on-chain verification.

- Plugin-Character-Dynamic

  A dynamic feature file loading plugin that updates Eliza's character files based on specific on-chain information for automated updates.

- Plugin-Character-GreenField

  Writes the "free will" data of AI agents‚Äîcharacter files, memory, knowledge‚Äîinto GreenField in near real-time. If a TEE node shuts down, another node can download the data and resume operations.
